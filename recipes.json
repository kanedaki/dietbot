    "method": [
      "To make the basic dough, line a baking tray with baking parchment (you may need two baking trays or, alternatively, cook the biscuits in batches).",
      "In a bowl, use a wooden spoon or a mixer to cream together the butter, sugar and vanilla essence until just creamy.  Do not over work the batter at this stage.  Beat in the egg until well combined. ",
      "Add the flour and mix on a low speed until a dough forms. In the bowl, use your hands to lightly knead the dough into a ball. Wrap it in cling film and refrigerate for least an hour.",
      "Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to a depth of about 5mm, if possible use spacers to achieve an even thickness. Cut the desired shapes. For the duck biscuits: use a duck-shaped cutter and a round cutter for the base (the base should be approximately the same size as the duck). For the tree biscuits: cut two simple tree shapes out using either a cutter or a template and cut one tree shape in half vertically. For the ladybird biscuits: cut out two rounds, one slightly smaller than the other (approx. 5cm\/2in and 3cm\/1\u00bcin). For the lamb biscuits: use a cutter or a template to cut out two lamb shapes for each finished biscuit and cut two additional leg shapes separately (for each finished lamb biscuit you should have two lamb shapes and two leg shapes). For the sitting down person biscuits: cut a gingerbread person out of the dough and then cut off the legs. Trim about 2mm from around the edges of the legs and cut two slots out of the bottom of the gingerbread body, about the depth of the legs (the legs will slot in here once baked). Also cut out two small ovals for feet.  ",
      "Transfer the shapes onto the baking sheet using a palate knife and chill again for about 30 minutes. (This is important to prevent the biscuits losing their shape when baked.)",
      "Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4.",
      "Bake the biscuits for 6\u201310 minutes, depending on size, until lightly golden-brown at the edges. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "For the icing, lightly beat the egg white in a large bowl.  Add the icing sugar and mix slowly at first to avoid an icing sugar cloud. Once combined, whisk or beat for about five minutes if using an electric beater or whisk, or for longer if using a wooden spoon. Continue whisking until the ingredients form a thick, smooth paste that is bright white in colour. If you are using colours, separate the icing into various bowls and colour accordingly.\r\n",
      "To decorate the duck biscuits, thinly roll out the yellow ready-to-roll icing and cover the duck shapes. Pipe on any decoration desired for the eyes, beaks and wings. Position a wire rack over a container that will hold it at a suitable height to lean the stand up biscuit against. Use the flooding technique to ice the biscuit circles (see step 10 for more information) to represent a pond. While the icing is still wet, place the round biscuit under the edge of the wire rack. Stand the duck biscuit in position on the wet icing on the round, using the rack as support to keep it upright. Allow the icing to set completely before carefully removing the support rack.\r\n",
      "To flood ice the biscuits, pipe an outline around the edge of the biscuit using either a fine nozzle or by snipping the very end off a disposable piping bag. Let the icing set for a few minutes. For flooding the icing needs to be slightly runnier, so add a few drops of water. Pipe or spoon enough of the runnier icing into the centre of the iced shape to completely fill it \u2013 don\u2019t worry about it being neat at this point. Use a toothpick to spread the icing evenly inside the hard icing \u2018wall\u2019. If the surface of the icing isn\u2019t flat, gently shake the biscuit back and forth until you have a smooth covering.",
      "To decorate the tree biscuits, pipe a line of green icing all around the edge and cover the biscuits using the flooding method described in step 10. Once the icing is completely dry, use some leftover icing to pipe a zig zag along the bare edge of each half tree and attach them to the middle of the whole trees  Repeat at the back of the biscuit with the remaining tree halves. You may have to hold the half trees in place while the icing sets.",
      "To decorate the ladybird biscuits, brush the rounds with cooled boiled water and cover the larger round with a circle of pink or red ready-to-roll icing and the smaller in white ready-to-roll icing. Attach the white round to the base using a small ball of ready-to-roll icing and tilt on an angle. Finish decorating the ladybird by piping on a face and spots in black icing.",
      "To decorate the lamb biscuits, ice half the bodies of the lambs using the flooding technique in step 10 - keeping the legs free of icing. Once the icing is dry, spread an undecorated lamb biscuit with icing and sandwich to the back of the decorated biscuit. Dot some icing on the back of the individual lamb legs and stick over the whole lamb\u2019s legs to give a 3D effect. When the icing is dry the biscuits should stand up without support. If desired, decorate the lamb\u2019s legs with icing.\r\n \r\n",
      "To decorate the sitting down person biscuits, decorate the biscuit bodies as desired. Slot the legs sideways into the precut slots so the person is sitting down with their legs stretched out in front of them.  Attach the feet to the bottom of the legs using icing and leave to dry.  "

Add the apples and cook in the caramel for 5 minutes, with a lid on, until they soften but still hold their shape (the centre will still be a little raw). Remove from the heat.",
      "For the comp\u00f4te, mix 50ml\/2fl oz of the apple juice with the sugar and pectin. Slide the chopped apple into a medium saucepan set over a medium heat. Add the remaining apple juice and cook for 10 minutes, covered with a lid, until the apples break down. Add the sugar\/pectin mix and vanilla pur\u00e9e or extract, stir and cook for a further 5 minutes to allow any moisture to evaporate. Remove from the heat.",
      "Preheat the oven to 210C\/190C Fan\/Gas 6\u00bd.",
      "To prepare the cake ring, lightly butter the inside of a 15x6cm\/6x2\u00bdin cake ring. Dip the ring in sugar so that the sugar coats the inside of the ring. Tap it lightly to ensure an even coating; tap off any excess. Lay out a 25cm\/10in square of aluminium foil, then cover it with the same size of parchment paper. Place the cake ring on top and roll up the foil and paper, so the foil holds tightly to the bottom of the ring \u2013 this will prevent any juices escaping. Place the ring on a baking tray.",
      "For the Charlotte, cut the slices of bread into 6cm\/2\u00bdin squares. Lightly spread both sides of the bread with the butter and fry in a large frying pan over a medium\u2013high heat for 20\u201330 seconds on one side, until evenly golden-brown. Transfer the bread to a plate or tray then use it to line the inside of the ring, browned sides facing outwards and overlapping by 2cm\/\u00bein. Press to ensure they stick to the sides.",
      "To build, mix the caramelised apple into the comp\u00f4te, then pour the mixture into the centre of the ring to fill the Charlotte. It will look too much and there will be a slight dome, but after cooking the apples will collapse under their own weight until they are level with the rim of the ring. Place the apple Charlotte in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely for a minimum of 3 hours. This will allow the pectin to set fully and firm up, which will also make the Charlotte easier to slice. Once cool, turn the Charlotte upside down by placing a large plate on top and flipping it over. Remove the foil and paper from the ring. You will need to heat the ring a little to lift it off smoothly; either use a blowtorch or place in an oven heated to 180C\/160C Fan\/Gas 4 for a minute, then ease it off gently.",
      "To serve, carefully cut the Charlotte into 6\u20138 pieces. This beautiful dessert can be served with vanilla ice cream or cr\u00e8me Chantilly. It\u2019s also perfect with a glass of your best cider."

Cook over a low heat without stirring until the sugar has melted. Increase the heat until the caramel turns a light golden-brown. Remove from the heat, put half the remaining butter in each pan and stir gently. Carefully arrange the sliced bananas in each pan.",
      "On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pastry to the thickness of a pound coin. Cut out two circles slightly larger than the circumference of the small frying pans (or one circle if using a single larger pan). Any leftover pastry can be frozen and used in other dishes. Cover each pan with a pastry round, pushing the edges down around the bananas. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly.",
      "To serve, invert a plate over the frying pans and turn out the tarts. Put a pile of ginger cake crumbs on each plate and a quenelle of the cream cheese mixture on top. Place a few chunks of caramelised banana next to it. Garnish with fresh mint."

Now melt the 50g\/2oz of butter in a pan.

I find 2 tbsp is about right for an 18cm\/7in pan. It's also helpful if you spoon the batter into a ladle so it can be poured into the hot pan in one go. As soon as the batter hits the hot pan, tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter. It should take only half a minute or so to cook; you can lift the edge with a palette knife to see if it's tinged gold as it should be. Flip the pancake over with a pan slice or palette knife - the other side will need a few seconds only - then simply slide it out of the pan onto a plate.",

Bring the liquid to a simmer and skim off any froth or scum that rises to the surface. Once the water is reasonably clear, place a crumpled piece of baking parchment, cut to the diameter of the pan, on top of the pork belly. This will help to keep the moisture in the pan during cooking.",

      "Lift the cooled pork out of the pan and place on a baking tray. Cover with cling film and refrigerate for at least an hour until it has firmed up, which will make it easier to slice. Once firm, remove the pork belly from the refrigerator and cut into individual portions. ",

      "Strain the bacon through a fine sieve and reserve the bacon flavoured oil. (The bacon is not used in this recipe.) Let the oil cool to room temperature before you begin to make the mayonnaise or it may split. ",
      "Whisk the egg yolk, vinegar and mustard together in a large bowl. Whisking continuously, drizzle the cooled bacon oil slowly into the bowl in a steady stream to create an emulsion. Once all the oil has been incorporated, add the lemon juice and soy sauce, which will thin down the mayonnaise. Taste and adjust the seasoning to taste. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.",
      "For the tomato chutney, heat the oil in saucepan and add the onion. Cook the onion over a medium heat for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic, paprika and lemongrass, and stir well. Gently cook for another five minutes, stirring every once in a while. ",
      "Heat the sugar in another dry pan until it melts and begins to caramelise to a golden-brown colour. Add the red wine vinegar and fish sauce to the caramel. If the caramel hardens upon contact with the liquid, stir the mixture for a few minutes until it dissolves. Pour this over the onion mixture and add the lime juice. Cook for a minute and add the diced tomatoes and stir well. Cook for a further minute then remove the pan from the heat.",
      "When you are about ready to serve, remove the thick rind from the pork belly. Heat a thin layer of olive oil in a frying pan. Add the pork belly pieces and fry for about two minutes on each side until golden-brown and warmed through. Toast the brioche buns and spread some bacon mayonnaise on the bottom halves.  Arrange a few lettuce leaves on each brioche base, then place pork belly pieces and a generous spoonful of tomato chutney on top. Cover with the brioche lids and serve at once."

Begin by melting the butter gently - don't over-heat it or let it brown, as this will affect the colour and flavour of the sauce. As soon as the butter melts, add the flour and, over a medium heat and using a small pointed wooden spoon, stir quite vigorously to make a smooth, glossy paste. Now begin adding the infused milk a little at a time - about 1fl oz\/25ml first of all and stir again vigorously. Then, when this milk is incorporated, add the next amount and continue incorporating each bit of liquid before you add the next. When about half the milk is in, switch to a balloon whisk and start adding large amounts of milk, but always whisking briskly. Your reward will be a smooth, glossy, creamy sauce.",
      "Now turn the heat down to its lowest setting and let the sauce cook for 5 minutes, whisking from time to time. While that's happening, taste and season with salt and freshly milled black pepper. If you wish to keep the sauce warm, all you do is pour it into a warmed jug and cover the surface with clingfilm to stop a skin from forming, then place the jug in a pan of barely simmering water."

      "You can make the cro\u00fbtons well ahead of time and, to do this, preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4. Drizzle the olive oil on to the baking sheet add the crushed garlic, then using either your hands or a piece of kitchen paper, spread the oil and garlic all over the baking sheet. Now place the bread slices on top of the oil, then turn them over so that both sides have been lightly coated with the oil. Bake for 20-25 minutes till crisp and crunchy.",
      "When you're ready to cook the beef, lower the oven temperature to 150C\/300F\/Gas 2. Take the flameproof casserole, place it over direct heat, then heat the oil until sizzling hot and fry the meat, 3 or 4 pieces at a time, until they turn a dark mahogany colour on all sides. Make sure you don't overcrowd the pan or they will create steam and never become brown. As you brown the meat remove it to a plate then, when all the meat is ready, add the onions to the pan, still keeping the heat high. Toss them around until they become darkly tinged at the edges - this will take about 5 minutes. After that add the crushed garlic, let that cook for about 30 seconds or so, then turn the heat down, return the meat to the casserole and sprinkle in the flour. Using a wooden spoon, stir until all the flour has been absorbed into the juices. It will look rather stodgy and unpromising at this stage but not to worry - the long slow cooking will transform its appearance.",
      "Now gradually stir in the beer and, when it's all in, let the whole thing gently come up to simmering point, and while that's happening add salt, freshly milled black pepper and the thyme and bay leaves. Then, just as it begins to bubble, put the lid on, transfer it to the centre shelf of the oven and leave it there for 2\u00bd hours. Don't be tempted to taste it now or halfway through the cooking as it does take 2\u00bd hours for the beer to mellow and become a luscious sauce.",
      "Just before you want to serve the beef, preheat the grill, spread the cro\u00fbtons with the mustard and sprinkle them with the grated gruy\u00e8re, then arrange them on top of the meat and pop the casserole under the grill until the cheese is bubbling. Then serve straight away."

Scatter the nuts over a baking tray and roast in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until golden-brown. Watch them carefully so that they don\u2019t have a chance to burn. Remove from the oven, tip onto a board and leave to cool.",
      "Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until light and creamy. Roughly chop the cooled nuts and add to the creamed butter and sugar, along with the lemon zest, flour and baking powder. Stir well until the mixture comes together and forms a ball \u2013 you may need to use your hands.",
      "Divide the biscuit dough into 24 even pieces and roll into small balls. Place the balls the prepared baking trays, spaced well apart to allow for spreading. ",
      "Press the biscuits to flatten to around 1cm\/\u00bdin thick. Bake the biscuits, one tray at a time, for 12 minutes or until very pale golden-brown. Leave to cool on the trays. They will be very soft when you take them out of the oven, but will crisp as they cool.",
      "Store in an airtight tin and eat within five days.",
      "For the fool, rinse the blackberries in a colander to wash away any dust or dirt. Put the blackberries in a non-stick saucepan and sprinkle over the caster sugar. ",
      "Stir in the lemon juice and heat gently for two minutes, or until the blackberries begin to soften and release their juices. Remove and reserve 12 blackberries for decoration and continue cooking the rest.",
      "Simmer the blackberries very gently for 15 minutes, stirring regularly until very soft and squidgy. Remove from the heat and press the berries and juice through a sieve over a bowl, using the bottom of a ladle to help you extract as much of the pur\u00e9e as possible. Leave the pur\u00e9e to cool and discard the seeds. You should end up with around 325ml\/11fl oz of pur\u00e9e. ",
      "Put the cream and yoghurt in a large bowl and whip with an electric whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl \u2013 the acidity of the fruit will thicken the cream further, so don\u2019t take it too far. ",
      "When the pur\u00e9e is completely cold, adjust the sweetness to taste by adding more sugar if needed. Pour it into the bowl with the whipped cream and yoghurt and stir just once or twice until very lightly combined. ",
      "Spoon the blackberry fool into individual wide, glass dishes \u2013 or one large, single bowl. It should look quite marbled, so don\u2019t over-stir it. Scatter a few tiny mint leaves on top and decorate with the reserved blackberries. Sprinkle with a little sugar if you like and serve with the hazelnut biscuits."

Add the olive oil and lemon juice and a good pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes. Drain the vegetables, reserving the cooking liquid, and discard the bay leaves. Place the vegetables in a food processor and blend with enough cooking liquid to make a pur\u00e9e with the consistency of whipped cream. Season with salt and freshly ground white pepper and keep warm.",
